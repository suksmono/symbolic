# symbolic
prototype of a full symbolic computing and ising simulation
1. user enter the problem in symbolic form
2. the symbolic unit process the input and gives coefficients of 2-body interaction
3. the coefficients are fed to a simulator, which is SA in this case
4. the simulator deliver the solution
